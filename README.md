# Public-Code
A collection of R scripts used in both the creation of the Antarctic Seafloor Annotated Imagery Database (AS-AID) and subsequent statistical analyses of the distribution of Antarctic seafloor fauna.
Please note that these scripts are not curated and simply represent a snapshot at the time of submission of the first research paper associated with this project. Once more curated scripts become available they will be shared here. 
Some scripts require computational runtimes of multiple days to weeks.
Contact Jan Jansen for any issues or questions.
