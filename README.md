# Public-Code
A collection of R scripts used in both the creation of the Antarctic Seafloor Annotated Imagery Database (AS-AID) and subsequent statistical analyses of the distribution of Antarctic seafloor fauna.

"CircumAntarcticBiodiversityHotspotDistribution" contains fully reproducible code that can be run with no edits. The code fits and analyses non-spatial joint-species distribution models to biodiversity data from the Antarctic Seafloor Annotated Imagery Dtabase (AS-AID) and environmental predictor variables. The runtime for this code is estimated at a few hours.

Scripts in all other folders require user input to edits pointers to file directories: they represent a snapshot at the time of submission of the first research paper associated with this project. Once scripts are curated further this description will be updated. IMPORTANT: Some scripts in these folders require computational runtimes of multiple days to weeks.

Contact Jan Jansen for any issues or questions.
